### Overview

V\OS is a reimplementation of the BeOS (and to some extent Haiku) userland on Linux, bringing the elegance and simplicity of a classic operating system to modern days. By leveraging the strengths of Linux while maintaining the user-friendly aspects of BeOS, V\OS offers a unique blend of performance and usability. V\OS leverages the power of linux by integrating ad-hoc built kernel modules for a reactive and enjoyable user experience.
